================

Welcome to my \#30DayChartChallenge. Clicking on a plot will take you to
the code I wrote to build it. Happy browsing, and if you like what you

## What is the April 2021 \#30DayChartChallenge?

This challenge is organised by [Dominic
Royé](https://twitter.com/dr_xeo) and [Cédric
Scherer](https://twitter.com/CedScherer). Participants source and tidy
their own data before creating a chart. The categories in the challenge
are inspired by [Jon Schwabish](https://twitter.com/jschwabish)’s [The
Graphic Continuum](https://policyviz.com/2014/09/09/graphic-continuum/).
Any tools are allowed, but I have used R to create all of the charts
below.
